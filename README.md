Replicate simulations from my BSc Thesis 

First simulation: "TFG_simulation_DGP.m"
  -function: "DGPTFG.m"
  
Second simulation: "simulation_TFG_002_alternative.m"
  -function: DGPTFG4.m
  
Third simulation: "timesimulation.m"  
 
PIE index: "PIE_average.m" (function)

The code of the files for the FMA estimators had already been coded by their authors (MMA and JMA code are available online).

Warning! The original Monte-Carlo simulation was done with 100 replications for the PIE index part. However, it took more than 24 hours for the first and second experiment separately, so if it is aimed just to check the validity of the code I would reccomend to lower the replications to 10, which may take less than 2 hours for each experiment.
