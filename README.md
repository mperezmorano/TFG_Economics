Replicate simulations from my BSc Thesis 

First simulation: "TFG_simulation_DGP.m"
  -function: "DGPTFG.m"
Second simulation: "simulation_TFG_002_alternative.m"
  -function: DGPTFG4.m
Third simulation: "timesimulation.m"  
 
PIE index: "PIE_average.m" (function)

The rest of the files uploaded have been coded by other authors (most of the codes are available online)

Warning! The original Monte-Carlo simulation was done with 100 replications for the PIe index part. However, it took more than 24 hours for the first and second experiment separately, so if it is aimed just to check the validity of the code I would reccomend to lower the replications to 10, which may take less than 2 hours for each experiment.
